Working directory and folders
-----------------------------

In my DATASCHOOL working directory, I created a new folders to organise my work.

I have a folder for my raw data, scripts and figures.

Using the drop down in R studio I have also created files, in which I will do my work.

These files are:

-   Create a new project in R studio

-   Create a new script file in R

-   Create a new markdown file

The advantage of creating a new project in R studio is that I am prompted to create a git repository

Creating a GIT repository.
--------------------------

When I select create a new project in R studio, I go onto create a new directory and new project, here is a small checkbox 'create git repository'. Once this is selcted I can go to R studio Termial to double check that I have respository.

GitHub Documents
----------------

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

Including Code
--------------

You can include R code in the document as follows:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

Including Plots
---------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
