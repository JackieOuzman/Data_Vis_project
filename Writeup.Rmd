## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Setting up my working environmnets.
In my DATASCHOOL working directory, I created a new folders to organise my work.
I have a folder for my raw data, scripts and figures.
Using the drop down in R studio I have also created files, which I will do my work:
These files are:
1. Create a new project in R studio
2. Create a new script file in R
3. Create a new markdown file

The advantage of creating a new project in R studio is that I am prompted to create a git repository

##Creating a GIT repository.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
maturity_data <- read_csv("Raw_data/Taylors_maturity_2015_2016.csv")
```
