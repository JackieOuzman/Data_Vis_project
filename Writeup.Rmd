## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## Setting up my working environmnets.
In my DATASCHOOL working directory, I created a new folders to organise my work.
I have a folder for my raw data, scripts and figures.
Using the drop down in R studio I have also created files, which I will do my work:
These files are:
1. Create a new project in R studio
2. Create a new script file in R
3. Create a new markdown file

The advantage of creating a new project in R studio is that I am prompted to create a git repository

##Creating a GIT repository.
When I select create a new project in R studio, I go onto create a new directory and new project, here is a small checkbox 'create git repository'.
Once this is selcted I can go to R studio Termial to double check that I have respository.

```{r}
## Question can I add code in markdown that relates to terminal?
#> git status (this gives an error)
#$ git status (this gives an error)
```
## Next step is to go to GitHub
log in, and create a new repostitory.
I selecetd public 
Simply follow the instructions 
'....or push on existing repository from command line'
copy the code and paste in R studio terminal - done!

This part is setting up a repsoitory on Github which allows my work to be pushed from my local computer to Github - Safe and sound!

##Staging, commiting and pushing in R studio
Again R studio makes things easy for me!
Git pane has a list of my files
Checkbox allows me to stage the files and then commit.
Adding a comment on the commit window.

At the end of the day I can push my files to Github using the push icon in the git window.



```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
maturity_data <- read_csv("Raw_data/Taylors_maturity_2015_2016.csv")
```
